(A).Overriding last recent git commit:-
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, exactly! When you use git commit --amend -m "new message", you are overriding the last commit. 
Essentially, you're editing the most recent commit to update its message, content, or both.

Exact-Command:-
git commit --amend -m "Feature: Project Status Overview

1. Backend (Flask & Django): CRUD operations are working as expected.
2. Frontend CRUD Operations: Frontend is working correctly for all CRUD operations.
3. Frontend Validation: Validation logic is in development and not yet implemented.
4. Integration: Frontend is properly integrated with both Flask and Django backends.
5. Development Progress: Validation is in progress, testing will follow once implemented.

-------------------------------------------------------------
(B).New git commit:-
-------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, using git commit -m "message" always creates a new commit. 
It does not override any previous commits, 
and the new commit is added on top of the existing commit history.

Exact-Command:-
git commit -m "Feature: Project Status Overview

1. Backend (Flask & Django): CRUD operations are functional and working as expected.
2. Frontend CRUD Operations: All CRUD operations on the frontend are properly functioning.
3. Frontend Validation: Validation logic is still under development and not implemented yet.
4. Integration: Frontend is integrated seamlessly with both Flask and Django backends.
5. Development Progress: Validation is in progress and testing will begin after completion.
