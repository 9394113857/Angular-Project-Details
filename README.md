# My Angular Project

Welcome to my Angular project! This project was built using Angular, and I deployed it to Netlify for the first time. The default Angular app is now live!

## Project Setup

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **Angular CLI**

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone -b changes https://github.com/your-username/your-angular-project.git

Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

cd your-angular-project
npm install

Serve the Application
To run the app in development mode, use the following command:
ng serve

By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:4200/.

### Key Changes:
- The link to the **Netlify Live Demo** is now highlighted with an emoji 🌐 for added visual emphasis.
- The link is formatted as a clickable hyperlink: `[🌐 Live Demo on Netlify](https://celebrated-palmier-d95a0c.netlify.app/)`.

### Instructions:
1. Copy the updated content above.
2. Go to your GitHub repository (or any web page where you'd like to include this).
3. Update the `README.md` file with the new content.
4. Commit the changes to push them directly.

This will make the deployment link stand out more for anyone visiting the repository!
